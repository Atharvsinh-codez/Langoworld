   LANGOWORLD — HACKATHON DEMO SCRIPT (10 MINUTES)
   Theme: BREAKING THE LANGUAGE BARRIER WITH AI
============================================================


[0:00 - 0:50] OPENING — THE PROBLEM
------------------------------------------------------------

"Hey everyone!

There are 7,000 languages spoken in the world. But most of
the internet — videos, tutorials, articles — is in just ONE
language: English.

Think about this. A brilliant coding tutorial on YouTube has
2 million views. But a student in Gujarat who speaks Gujarati
cannot understand it. A developer in Japan who speaks only
Japanese cannot learn from it. A man in Brazil who speaks
Portuguese is locked out of that knowledge.

THIS is the language barrier. And it affects BILLIONS of
people every single day.

We built LangoWorld to break that barrier.

LangoWorld takes ANY YouTube video, ANY uploaded video, or
ANY document — summarizes it with AI — and translates it
into 25 languages — with AI voice that reads it aloud.

All from one beautiful workspace. Let me show you."


[0:50 - 1:30] LANDING PAGE AND LOGIN
------------------------------------------------------------

"This is LangoWorld. Our landing page is built with Next.js
16 and React 19. These animations you see are powered by
GSAP — giving a premium, modern feel.

For authentication, we use Supabase — email and password
login with Row-Level Security. This means every user's data
is completely private. No one can see your translations or
summaries except you.

Let me log in."

ACTION: Click Get Started → Log in → Enter workspace


[1:30 - 3:30] YOUTUBE SUMMARIZATION
------------------------------------------------------------

"Welcome to our workspace. This is a React Flow canvas.
Everything you see here is a draggable, interactive node.

Now imagine — you found a 40-minute YouTube video about
machine learning. You do not have time to watch it. No
problem. Just paste the URL here."

ACTION: Paste a YouTube URL → Click Submit

"Here is what happens behind the scenes:

First — our Python Flask backend extracts the video
transcript using a library called pytubefix.

Second — that transcript goes through our smart request
queue to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash. Gemini reads the entire
transcript and generates a full summary, key points with
timestamps, and a detailed explanation.

Third — everything is saved to our Supabase database, and a
beautiful summary card appears right here on the canvas."

ACTION: Wait for result → Click the summary card

"Here is the full summary page. You can see the AI summary,
key points with timestamps, and even auto-generated chapters.

But here is the magic — watch what happens when I select
some text."

ACTION: Select text on the summary page

"A popup appears. I can Read Aloud this text with AI voice.
Or I can Translate and Replace it — right here, inline. If I
pick Hindi, the English text is replaced with Hindi
instantly. This is powered by lingo.dev SDK.

So now, that machine learning tutorial? A student in India
can read it in Hindi. A student in Japan can read it in
Japanese. The language barrier is GONE."


[3:30 - 4:30] VIDEO UPLOAD AND ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------------------

"YouTube is great. But what if you have your OWN video? Maybe
a lecture recording? A training video from your company?

No problem. I just drag and drop the file right here."

ACTION: Upload a short video file

"The video uploads to Cloudflare R2 — that is our CDN
storage. Then Gemini AI analyzes the ACTUAL video — not just
audio, but the visual content too. It can see slides, charts,
diagrams, everything.

And both features run in PARALLEL. You can summarize a
YouTube video AND upload your own video at the same time.
No blocking. No waiting."


[4:30 - 5:00] DOCUMENT UPLOAD
------------------------------------------------------------

"We also support documents — PDFs, text files, Word docs.
Same flow. Upload, AI analyzes it, summary appears on the
canvas. Everything saved to your account.

So whether it is a video, a document, or just text — 
LangoWorld can handle it."


[5:00 - 7:00] TRANSLATION — THE CORE FEATURE
------------------------------------------------------------

"Now let me show you the heart of LangoWorld — our
translation system. This is where we truly break the
language barrier.

Let me open the translation panel."

ACTION: Click the translate icon on the canvas

"Watch this carefully. I am going to type some text in Hindi."

ACTION: Type: नमस्ते दुनिया

"See that? The system AUTOMATICALLY DETECTED that this is
Hindi — with 99 percent confidence. That green badge says
Auto-detected.

How does this work? When you type, the text is sent to our
Python backend with a 500-millisecond delay. Our backend
uses Google's langdetect library — it can identify over 50
languages automatically. The result comes back with the
language code and a confidence score.

It works for ALL 25 languages we support. Let me show you.

I will type Chinese."

ACTION: Clear and type: 你好世界

"Instantly detected — Chinese, 99 percent confidence.

Now let me type Arabic."

ACTION: Clear and type: مرحبا بالعالم

"Arabic — detected perfectly.

This is the power of backend AI detection. You do not need
to manually select the source language. Just type in ANY
language and LangoWorld figures it out.

Now let me translate. I will type an English sentence and
select multiple target languages."

ACTION: Type "Education should have no language barrier"
      → Select Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese
      → Click Translate

"Each translation goes through the lingo.dev SDK on our
server. Watch — the results appear one by one as beautiful
cards on the canvas.

Each card shows the country flag, the translated text, and
the original English text for reference. You can copy any
translation with one click.

And notice — the source language English is automatically
EXCLUDED from the target list. If the detected source
matches a selected target, it auto-swaps. This prevents
translating English to English by accident.

This is not Google Translate embedded in a page. This is a
purpose-built, AI-powered translation engine that uses
lingo.dev — one of the most accurate translation APIs
available — supporting 25 plus languages."


[7:00 - 8:00] READ ALOUD — AI VOICE
------------------------------------------------------------

"But translation is not enough. What about people who cannot
read? What about visually impaired users? What about someone
who just wants to LISTEN?

That is why we built Read Aloud."

ACTION: Click Read Aloud on the Spanish translation card

"This button uses Google Gemini Text-to-Speech. Here is the
flow:

The text is sent to our server. Gemini generates audio in
PCM format. We convert it to WAV format. Then we upload the
audio file to Cloudflare R2 — our CDN.

The first time takes about 2 to 3 seconds. But the second
time you play it? INSTANT. Zero API calls. Because the audio
is already cached on R2.

And if Gemini TTS ever fails — maybe the API is down — we
automatically fall back to the browser's built-in speech
engine. The user NEVER sees an error. The voice always plays.

So now, that Hindi student? They can LISTEN to the summary
in Hindi. The Japanese student can LISTEN in Japanese. We
are not just translating text — we are making knowledge
ACCESSIBLE in every possible way."


[8:00 - 8:30] TRANSLATION HISTORY
------------------------------------------------------------

"Every translation is automatically saved to Supabase. See
this history node?

All your past translations survive page reloads. You can
come back tomorrow and they are still here. You can scroll
through them, see the original text, all the languages you
translated to, and delete any one you want.

This is powered by a dedicated translation_history table in
PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security — only YOU can see YOUR
translations."


[8:30 - 9:00] UI TRANSLATION — FULL INTERFACE
------------------------------------------------------------

"One more thing about breaking the language barrier. We do
not just translate YOUR text. We translate OUR ENTIRE APP.

Watch this."

ACTION: Click the language switcher → Select Japanese

"Every single button, label, heading, and menu item just
translated to Japanese. The entire interface is now in
Japanese.

This uses the lingo.dev SDK with 3-layer caching — server
memory, browser localStorage, and React state. So switching
languages is fast, and the app NEVER shows broken text.

If you are a Hindi speaker, the app speaks Hindi. If you
are a French speaker, the app speaks French. LangoWorld
adapts to YOU."

ACTION: Switch back to English


[9:00 - 9:30] SCALABILITY AND ARCHITECTURE
------------------------------------------------------------

"Let me quickly talk about what is under the hood.

We have Smart API Key Rotation. We use multiple Gemini API
keys in a pool. If one key gets rate-limited, it
automatically switches to the next healthy key. Each key
has its own health score — failure count, cooldown timer,
and success rate.

We have a Request Queue with a maximum of 5 concurrent
Gemini API calls, exponential backoff retry, and smart
error classification. This means LangoWorld can handle
100 plus concurrent users without crashing.

Our tech stack:
— Next.js 16 with React 19 for the frontend
— Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for AI and TTS
— lingo.dev SDK for translations
— Supabase for auth and database
— Cloudflare R2 for CDN storage
— Python Flask with langdetect for backend
— Inngest for background job processing
— React Flow for the interactive canvas
— GSAP and Framer Motion for animations"


[9:30 - 10:00] CLOSING — THE MISSION
------------------------------------------------------------

"Let me leave you with this thought.

Right now, 40 percent of the world does not have access to
education in their native language. Millions of students
struggle because the best content is in a language they
do not speak.

LangoWorld changes that.

Paste a YouTube video — get a summary in YOUR language.
Upload a lecture — get the key points in YOUR language.
Type anything — hear it spoken in YOUR language.

We are not just building an app. We are breaking down the
walls that language puts between people and knowledge.

Because education should have NO language barrier.

Thank you."


============================================================
   DEMO TIPS — READ BEFORE PRESENTING
============================================================

1. PRE-LOAD: Have a short YouTube video (under 5 min)
   ready. Longer videos take more time to summarize.

2. PRE-TYPE: Keep Hindi text (नमस्ते दुनिया) and Chinese
   text (你好世界) copied somewhere for quick paste during
   the auto-detect demo.

3. BACKUP TAB: Have a summary page already loaded in a
   second browser tab in case the live demo takes too long.

4. SPEAK SLOW: Pause 2 to 3 seconds after each demo action
   so the audience can see the result on screen.

5. ENERGY: Start strong with the problem statement. Get
   louder when you say "the language barrier is GONE."
   End with conviction on "no language barrier."

6. TIMING: Practice twice. The YouTube summarization takes
   the longest (30 to 60 seconds). Fill that time by
   explaining the architecture.

7. INTERNET: Make sure you have stable internet. The
   Python backend, Gemini API, lingo.dev, and Supabase
   all need connectivity.

8. SERVERS: Before the demo, make sure ALL 3 servers are
   running:
   — Terminal 1: npm run dev (Next.js on port 3000)
   — Terminal 2: python server.py (Flask on port 5123)
   — Terminal 3: npx inngest-cli@latest dev (port 8288)
